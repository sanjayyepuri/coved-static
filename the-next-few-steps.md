# The next few steps

At the moment, I'm not actively developing new features on the website. I can provide guidance, help deploy changes, and **maybe** code a thing or two.&#x20;

However, I do want to make sure that the site & documentation is at a state where anyone with some CS / WebDev knowledge can start work on it.  With that in mind, the next few pages are going to be focused on building the site, deploying changes, and pointing out any low-hanging fruit.&#x20;
