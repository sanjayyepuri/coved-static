# FAQ

* **There are many GitHub repos, which ones are relevant?**
  * First iteration: [CovEducation/CovEd](https://github.com/CovEducation/CovEd)
  * Second iteration:
    * Early development + third party version: [CovEducation/CovEducation](https://github.com/CovEducation/CovEducation)
    * Post-third party version (final): [CovEducation/Website](https://github.com/CovEducation/Website)
  * Third iteration: [CovEducation/coveducation.github.io](https://github.com/CovEducation/coveducation.github.io)
  * As of right now, only the third iteration is relavant, although feel free to reuse any components from the first or second iteration.&#x20;
* **How is coved.org linked to coveducation.github.io?**
  * The website uses GitHub pages for hosting, hence the need to redirect coved.org -> coveducation.github.io. The actual domain is held via Google Domains. I believe that coved.dev@gmail.com has the authorization to manage this domain.&#x20;
* **Do we use any third party services?**
  * We did at one point!
    * MongoDB: Hosted the user data (I believe the database is still alive?)
    * Mailchimp: Sent emails&#x20;
    * Twilio: Sent SMS
    * Firebase: User authentication
    * Google Analytics: Usage tracking (**This is still active**).
  * I recomment using [DownNotifier](http://downnotifier.com) to know if the site ever crashes. This is unlikely, unless there is some DNS misconfiguration.
* **How do I get access?**
  * DM @dheekshu, @sanjay, and/or I and we'll help setting up your credentials.
